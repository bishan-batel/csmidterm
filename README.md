## Definition of an algorithm
A series of 
* Unambiguious 
* Ordered
* Executable steps
* That define a terminating process


## Write & Read Pseuldocode
* Can be written in JETS, AKA just write it in Java.

## Read IB Flowcharts

## Read Gant Charts

## Define and label pre & post conditions
### Pre Condition
A pre condition is a condition that the algorithm assumes is true
### Post Condition
A post condition is a condition you assume is true of the output of the algorithm

### Example Case: Binary Sort
#### Pre Condition
The array is sorted
#### Post Condition
The algorithm found whether or not the target is in the array sucessfully 

## Concurrency vs Sequential

## Big O Notation
## Sort & Search Algorithms
### Linear Search
